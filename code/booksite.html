            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
            <p>
                The roots of fantasy lie in old fairy tales and folklore, even though these stories are not deliberately called fantasy, they contain many fantastic elements. Works such as the Arabian Nights laid the foundation of the genre.

                The genre was explicitly called fantasy starting in the 19th century, where authors such as George MacDonald started making fantasy novels.

                    ‘I should like to save the Shire, if I could – though there have been times when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words, and have felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them. But I don’t feel like that now. I feel that as long as the Shire lies behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable: I shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand there again.’

                <h3>A Song of Ice and Fire</h3>
                <p>
                    A Song of Ice and Fire, more commonly known by the name of its first book, Game of Thrones, is a series of books created by George R.R. Martin in the land of Westeros, being released almost 50 years after the first Lord of the Rings book. The book was written when modern fantasy was very established. Yet, some would say it revolutionalised the genre, with Martin being called the American Tolkein. A Song of Ice and Fire introduced a lot more adult themes in the genre and includes large amounts of violence and sexual content. An exerpt from the first book of the series: Game of Thrones can be seen below.

                    'Until tonight. Something was different tonight. There was an edge to this darkness that made his hackles rise. Nine days they had been riding, north and northwest and then north again, farther and farther from the Wall, hard on the track of a band of Wildling raiders. Each day had been worse than the day that had come before it. Today was the worst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and it made the trees rustle like living things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something cold and implacable that loved him not. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted nothing so much as to ride hellbent for the safety of the Wall, but that was not a feeling to share with your commander.'

                    The books became popular with readers, and it launched a TV show bearing the name of the first book, Game of Thrones.

                <p>
                    The show was very successful, getting renewed for multiple seasons, however, the final season of the show remains controversial as fans believe the ending to the show was too rushed.
